# 🛠️ Random Projects - C & Python

A collection of small, self-contained projects written in **C** and **Python** — built for practice, experimentation, and learning.

## 🧠 What's Inside?

### 🔹 C Projects
- Console-based programs written in pure C
- Includes mini-games, algorithm tests, and basic utilities
- Great for strengthening fundamentals in memory management, logic, and control flow

### 🔹 Python Projects
- Small tools and text-based applications
- Focuses on logic building, scripting, and basic UI (CLI or minimal GUI)
- Ideal for early Python practice and prototyping

> All projects are standalone and require no external libraries unless otherwise mentioned in the file.

## 📌 Notes

* These are **practice-only** projects — no production-grade code here!
* Useful as a sandbox for revisiting concepts or exploring new ones
